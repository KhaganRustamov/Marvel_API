This project is based on the API. The web application receives data from the server, namely characters and comics. Here, a functional approach to creating components using hooks was used, internal navigation was created using a router, and dynamic imports were used to quickly load this web application. Here the interface displays lists of characters and comics from the Marvel universe, by clicking on which we can get additional information about them.
